# CodeAlpha_UnempolymenAnalysis
This repository contains the Unemployment Analysis Project completed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship. The project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization of unemployment trends, including the impact of Covid-19, using Python.

Unemployment Rate Analysis & Visualization (2019–2022)

Project Overview:
The main objectives of this project are:
.To simulate unemployment rate data
.To analyze trends over multiple years
.To visualize unemployment patterns using graphs
.To compare unemployment rates before and after COVID-19

Technologies Used
.Python
.NumPy
.Pandas
.Matplotlib
.Seaborn

Dataset Description
.Years: 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022
.Months: January to December
.Unemployment Rate: Randomly generated values (percentage)
.Data Type: Synthetic (for learning & visualization purposes)

 Visualizations Included
1️⃣ Line Plot
.Shows unemployment trend over time
.X-axis: Date
.Y-axis: Unemployment Rate (%)

2️⃣ Box Plot
.Displays year-wise unemployment distribution
.Helps compare variation across years

3️⃣ Bar Plot
.Shows average monthly unemployment
.Identifies seasonal unemployment patterns

COVID-19 Analysis
The project compares:
.Before COVID (2019)
.During/After COVID (2020–2022)
This helps understand the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment rates.

Output:
Example:Average Unemployment Rate:
Before Covid: 5.12
During/After Covid: 6.85
(Values may change due to random data generation)
